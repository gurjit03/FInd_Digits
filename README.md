# FInd_Digits
Find Digits that are exactly divisible by that Number

You are given an integer N. Find the digits in this number that exactly divide N (division that leaves 0 as remainder) and display their count. For N=24, there are 2 digits (2 & 4). Both of these digits exactly divide 24. So our answer is 2.

<h3>Note</h3>

If the same number is repeated twice at different positions, it should be counted twice, e.g., For N=122, 2 divides 122 exactly and occurs at ones' and tens' position. So for this case, our answer is 3.
Division by 0 is undefined.
